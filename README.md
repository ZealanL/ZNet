# ZNet
Simple and efficient neural network library written in C#.

# Features
Configurable network tweaking (i.e. changing hidden layer activation function)
Well-optimized and preformant (uses fast local matrix operations)
Currently only supports feed forward networks.

# Roadmap (Things I want to do)
Support RNN and CNNs, with their own training methods.
More configurability/more ways to design a model.
Native C++ conversion for optimal speed.
Dynamic neural networks and more biologically-accurate model types.
GPU support? Maybe?
